# Objects

We can therefore import various elements into our project from the hierarchy as well as from the Media Library.

![Hierarchy](/img/UI_hierarchy1.png) 

### Basic Shapes

You can import several types of standard shapes, often used in 3D software to quickly sketch ideas.

### Empty 

If you import an Empty object, represented by a circle, you can use it 
for certain behaviors that are not available on mesh objects (like the shapes above). 
Indeed, if you want to create a Smartboard, a Timer, or a teleportation point, you will need an empty object.

### Text

 To the left of Content, there is a button that allows you to link a line from the TextDataBase.

-Text Color: allows you to select the text color.
-Outline Color: allows you to select the color of the text outline.
-Background Color: allows you to select the background color of the text. 
It is recommended to keep it in order to ensure readability at all times.



### Waypoint chain

A Waypoint chain allows you to create a series of points linked together, forming a path.
This path can be used to guide objects with the animate behavior.

Use the shortcut "P" to quickly add points when the Waypoint chain is selected.

### Particle Emitter

By importing a Particle Emitter, you can create effects like smoke, fire, and others.

![Particle](/img/UI_Praticle.JPG)

-*Particle Visual*: allows you to select the desired visual for the particle.
-*Gravity Direction*: indicates the direction of the gravity effect on the particles.
-*Gravity Factor*: allows you to select the intensity of the gravity.
-*Particle Color Start*: allows you to select the color of the particle at the start of its life.
-*Particle Color End*: allows you to select the color of the particle at the end of its life.
-*Particle Size*: allows you to select the size of the particle.
-*Particle Lifetime*: allows you to select the lifetime of a particle.
-*Loop Duration*: allows you to select the duration of the loop.
-*Rate (per second)*: allows you to select the number of particles generated per second.
-*Starting Speed*: allows you to select the speed of a particle at the start of its creation.
-*Origin Shape*: allows you to select the shape in which the particles will be created.
-*Origin Size*: allows you to select the size of the origin shape.
-*Looping*: allows you to select whether the particle emitter loops or not.
-*Pre-Simulate*: allows you to select whether the particle emitter is pre-simulated when entering a step or if the simulation will start upon entering the step.
