# Sauvegarder un projet VR

Saving the file updates the .logia.
This .logia is easily readable and free to access on the Reader version of Logia/Practice. Sending it to a third party has no particular restrictions.
The experience can be read as long as the Reader/Editor versions are compatible with the recorded version.

You can either save the file by selecting "Save" or save and create a copy by selecting "Save As."
