Each Step consists of several parts.

![Step Detailed 2](/img/node_detailed_2.png)

### 1 Condition Group

A *Condition Group* is a set of *Conditions*. Each *Condition* is applied to an object in the scene. All conditions within a group must be met in order to transition to the Step connected to the output of this group. For more details on Conditions, visit the section [Conditions & Behaviours](conditions.md).

Clicking on the *-* to the left of the group name will destroy the *Condition Group*.

### 2 Menu

You can access the menu by clicking on the *...* at the top right of the Step. Different options will be available:

    *Settings*: Opens the Step options in the Inspector.
    *Delete step*: Deletes the current Step.
    *Disconnect in*: Removes the connection link between the previous Step and the input of this Step.
   *Disconnect out*: Removes the output links to the following Steps.
    *Disconnect all*: Removes both the input and output links.

### 3 Entr√©e

The input allows it to be linked to the output of the previous Step.
To connect two Steps, click on an output of a Condition Group from a previous Step, then click on the input of the next Step.

### 4 Sortie(s)

The outputs of the Step are links to other Steps if a Condition Group is validated. There is one output per Condition Group. A Step cannot have fewer than one Condition Group.

### 5 Add Condition Group
Add a Condition Group, along with the associated output linked to it.
