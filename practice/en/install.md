# Installation

## Installation de l'Ã©diteur

In order to use the Practice Editor, you should launch `PracticeEditorInstaller.exe` provided by Altheria. In most cases Microsoft Defender SmartScreen will block the installer has it is not yet recognized by Microsoft's database.

At the start of the installer, the terms of the license are presented. 
These have a full version found in the EULA signed by your organization.

## VR headset setup

Practice is fully compatible with the OpenXR standard[^1], so you will be able to use a wide range of virtual reality headsets available on the market.

In order to connect the headset to Practice, you will need to use an intermediary known as a runtime. There are two main ones on Windows: SteamVR[^2] and Oculus[^3], but the choice of runtime depends on the headset you have. We recommend using the Oculus runtime for headsets developed by Meta and SteamVR for the others.

[^3]: [Oculus](https://www.meta.com/be/quest/setup/)

### Oculus

The Oculus runtime is compatible with Meta headsets (Rift and all Quest variants). Quest headsets must be connected to the computer via a Link cable. 

For more information regarding the setup of your Oculus headset, we recommend following [Meta's officials informations'](https://www.meta.com/fr-fr/help/quest/articles/headsets-and-accessories/oculus-link/set-up-link/).

### SteamVR

The SteamVR runtime must be installed through the Steam distribution platform[^4]. Steam requires the creation of an account to use its services.

The installation process is similar for all devices, with a few hardware-specific configuration differences. A non-exhaustive list for configuring devices with SteamVR:

- Valve Index: [guide](https://help.steampowered.com/fr/faqs/view/7F7D-77FB-8CAA-4329).
- HTC Vive: [guide](https://www.vive.com/fr/support/vive/category_howto/setting-up-for-the-first-time.html).

### Other

Other connected headsets are available on the market with proprietary applications, such as Varjo[^5] or Pico[^6]. However, these applications use a runtime like SteamVR to communicate with VR applications.

Once the installation is complete and the headset is initialized, move on to the section [Project Management](editor_features_basic/project_management).
