# Language Management

Practice includes a module that allows you to integrate multiple versions of your texts in different languages, enabling you to switch from one language to another with a single click once the experience is finalized.

It is important to link the texts in the text boxes to a textDB/.csv as early as possible in order to easily update your experience in other languages without having to assign the boxes again in the future. This process is described here: https://docs.altheria.com/docs/features_basic/importer_medialib#sheetdata-viewer.

If you have updated your .csv, you can press the "Update All" button to update the new texts.
